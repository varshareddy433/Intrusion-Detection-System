# Intrusion Detection System - A Machine Learning Approach for Network Security

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using machine learning techniques to classify network traffic as normal or an attack. It leverages the **NSL-KDD dataset** to train and evaluate machine learning models, including **Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree**, to predict different types of intrusions accurately.

## Features
- **Real-time intrusion detection**: Classifies network traffic into normal or attack categories.
- **Multiple ML algorithms**: Implements **SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree** for attack detection.
- **Feature extraction & preprocessing**: Handles categorical and numerical data for effective training.
- **Performance evaluation**: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and computation time.

## Dataset
The **NSL-KDD dataset** is used for training and testing, which includes various types of network attacks categorized into DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R.

## Model Training & Evaluation
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Encoding categorical values, feature scaling, and data splitting.
2. **Training Models**: Using different classifiers like Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree.
3. **Evaluation**: Comparing models based on accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Usage
The trained model takes network traffic features as input and predicts whether the traffic is normal or an attack.

## Project Impact
This system enhances **cybersecurity by detecting malicious network activities**, preventing potential threats, and ensuring secure network communication.
